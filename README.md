# Tally

Tally is a simple web app that lets you keep a tally of little things like how many UFOs you’ve seen, how many days you’ve taken your vitamins, or how many coffees you’ve had today.

I made Tally partly as a way to learn more about [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) (specifically using stores and components).

Tally uses your browser's local storage so there’s no signing in or sending your data anywhere—it’s all stored locally on your machine. _That also means your tallys don’t come with you if you switch devices/browsers or clear your storage._
